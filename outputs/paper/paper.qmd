# Introduction

* Even numbers => Milk first 

* Measurement =>Â¼ Tea per cup, 1 tablespoon of milk per cup
* Tea was steeped with 1 tea bag in 8 ounces of water for 4 minutes 

# Experiment Challenges

** Approach => Pour tea to all cups from the same pot 
** 16 oz measuring cup, 2 oz of tea in each cup
* Accuracy of measurement
